    "The reason that the ants have troubles with looping paths is that we are not using a tabu list. If we were to employ a tabu list, loops would not be possible by construction, since they would involve visiting already visited nodes. Without the list, however, the ants can only rely on the distances to the next nodes and the amount of pheromones on each edge. Because of that, there is a chance that they choose \"wrong\" and use a sub-optimal path. \n",

    "Firstly, the results of the algorithm depend on the number of ants that are used. As shown in the book, when using a small number of ants there is a higher possibility of the ants converging to the sub-optimal loop-free top path. If we use enough ants, however, we would expect that they can find their way through the more complex bottom paths and converge towards (locally) optimal solutions."
