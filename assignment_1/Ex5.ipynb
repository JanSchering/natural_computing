In other words, the larger $\\lambda$ is, the more similar the search of the strategy is to the search for an optimal solution in a greedy algorithm. As $\\lambda$ decreases, the size of the investigated local search neighborhood decreases (see explanation above on why (1+5)ES explores more of the local neighborhood than (1+1)ES). Conversely, this means that the larger $\\lambda$, the larger the investigated local search neighborhood. This means that we are approaching local optimality with increasing $\\lambda$."
