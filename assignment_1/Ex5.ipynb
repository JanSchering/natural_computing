    "On the one hand, a (1+1) ES involves one parent that yields one offspring and only the best of the two survives. On the other hand, a (1+5) ES involves one parent that yields five offsprings and only the best of the six survives. By generating five offsprings and having to choose the best individual out of a pool of six candidates, the chances of having an individual with a better fitness than the parent increases as compared to generating one single offspring. In optimizing a function, fewer steps should be needed for the optimum to be found since less states of the state space will be explored. The search for an optimal solution is thus more local when using a (1+1) ES than a (1+5) ES."
